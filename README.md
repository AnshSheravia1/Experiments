# Experiments
Various ML Projects and Experiments on which I have worked on.

1) Stocks.ipynb - Using the stock data of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase from 2000 to 2023, visualized different co-relations, calculated dividends, created a prediction system using Polynomial Regression to predict the Adjusted Closing Price given Open, Close, High, Low and Volume. 

2) SpaceshipTitanic.ipynb(Kaggle Competition) - Intro : Welcome to the year 2912, where your data science skills are needed to solve a cosmic mystery.
We've received a transmission from four lightyears away and things aren't looking good.
The Spaceship Titanic was an interstellar passenger liner launched a month ago. With almost 13,000 passengers on board, the vessel set out on its maiden voyage transporting emigrants from our solar system to three newly habitable exoplanets orbiting nearby stars.
While rounding Alpha Centauri en route to its first destination—the torrid 55 Cancri E—the unwary Spaceship Titanic collided with a spacetime anomaly hidden within a dust cloud. Sadly, it met a similar fate as its namesake from 1000 years before. Though the ship stayed intact, almost half of the passengers were transported to an alternate dimension!
To help rescue crews and retrieve the lost passengers, you are challenged to predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly using records recovered from the spaceship’s damaged computer system.
Help save them and change history!
** I have used Catboost Classifier to predict whether the passengers have transformed or not, I have achieved 81% accuracy in the posted attempt.**
